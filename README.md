## DELANI STUDIO

## By Fatuma ali

## Description
+ Delani studio is a basic website aimed at helping students familiarize with various jQuery and bootsrap concepts.


## Behaviour Driven Development(BDD)
In 'What We do' icons when clicked should toggle between the respective description of each icons. The description and header should be centered aligned and appear in bold. I have created a hover effect for the 'portfolio' section such that on hover a white box appears with the name of the project inside as the pictures remains visible in the background.
